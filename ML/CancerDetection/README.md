# E2E-ChestCancer-MlFlow-DVC (Basic Version)

This repository contains a basic version of the end-to-end machine learning project focused on chest cancer detection. This simplified version serves as an introduction to the core concepts and methodologies used in the full project.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of detecting chest cancer from histopathological images. This repository includes essential components such as data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

### Key Features

- Basic data preprocessing steps
- Model training using a selected machine learning algorithm
- Evaluation metrics to assess model performance

## Requirements

To run this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (see `requirements.txt` for details)
